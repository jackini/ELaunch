# ELaunch [WIP]
## Intro
A launcher based on Electron and inspired by [UAfred](https://github.com/zhenyangze/uafred), now only support linux and MacOS.

## Download

see [release](https://github.com/zaaack/ELaunch/releases)



## Config

> Custom config path: `~/.ELaunch/config.js`

Plugins in default config are built-in plugins, you can overwrite them or add new plugin in custom config(`~/.ELaunch/config.js`). After the program started, it would automatically merge custom config.js to config.default.js. If you want to use platform-specific config, you can add `linux/darwin/win32` fields in plugin config and them would be merged into plugin config according to `process.platform`. This works in command config too. See [default config](app/config/config.default.js).

## Usage

>Default Shotcut: Super+Space for linux and windows, Cmd+Space for MacOS

Then you can type in app names or commands, see [Screen Captures](#Screen Captures) below.
